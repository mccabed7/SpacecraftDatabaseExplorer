# SpacecraftDatabaseExplorer
In the 1st year module Programming Project, I was part of a 4-person team to create 
an application that allowed a user to navigate and interact with a large database of information relating to tens of 
thousands of real-life spacecrafts. We used Processing (a modified version of Java) to create the program, and used 
Apache Subversion as our version control software. We had to build the program from the ground up, which meant 
parsing in the data from a file and storing it in appropriate data structures. The UI (as well as the UI Event Manager) 
was entirely of our own creation as well.
